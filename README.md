# TE-capstone-1-VendingMachine
Vending Machine Capstone project 
This is our very first capstone project with Tech Elevator, the project is done with the collaboration of my partner Dennis utilizing Java OOP.
This is a vending machine program that allows users to feed (input) money, purchase items (snacks), and receive change from the program. 
The program also has a logger class that records sales activities as well as inventory.
The Menu class was already provided in the initial code. The rest of the codes were completed by us.
